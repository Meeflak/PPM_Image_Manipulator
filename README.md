# PPM_Image_Manipulator
<pre>
This was an exercise in data manipulation! 

The goal of this program was to create an image manipulator that took in PPM images and manipulated them based off a set of different commands
that could be ran by the program

This program was a test in my ability to parse a file and manipulate its data in a way that could be scaled to images of any size. 

The files to be loaded are currently hard coded as they are just a test of my ability to perform the task, but this program could be easily
changed to allow for any PPM image to be input by a user.
